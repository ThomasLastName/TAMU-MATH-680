# TAMU-MATH-680
This is some code that I wrote as a teaching assistant for the class MATH 680 at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) for the class's python labs. The labs (by means of this code) demonstrate concrete applications of the concepts presented in lecture, including several exercises.

# Installation

### Prerequisites
- [x] Have python installed and know how to edit run python files
- [x] Know the directory where python is installed on your computer. You can retrieve this in the interactive terminal by commanding `import os; import sys; print(os.path.dirname(sys.executable))`
- [x] Have the folder `quality_of_life` already stored in your `Lib` folder (this has its own installation steps similar to those for this repo).
- [x] Have the prerequisite packages installed:
    - `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `quality_of_life` for minimal functionality
    - `tensorflow`, `pytorch`, `sklearn` for ~98% functionality
    -  `alive_progress` for complete functionality (this is included for my own sanity when writing the code)

### Installation Steps Using the Graphical Interface
1. Click the colorful `<> Code` button and select `Download ZIP` from the dropdown menu. This should download a zipped folder called `TAMU_MATH_680` containing within it an unzipped folder of the same name, in turn containing two folders: `answers_680` and `labs_680`
2. Move the `answers_680` folder into the `Lib` folder of your preferred version of python.
3. Move the `labs_680` to wherever you prefer to keep most of your python scripts.

## Usage
Each of the files in the `labs_680` contains multiple reproducible demonstations, as well as 1-3 exercises. There will typically be
